# Credit Risk Modelling in Python

This repository contains projects and code developed as part of the **Credit Risk Modelling in Python** course by Rajat Kumar. The focus is on building and validating key credit risk models—Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD), and Exposure at Default (EAD)—using Python and real-world inspired datasets.

## Project Overview

- Developed end-to-end credit risk models on datasets of 10,000+ loans.
- Used logistic regression, decision trees, and other machine learning techniques to estimate PD, LGD, and EAD.
- Optimized classification metrics with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) exceeding 0.80, ensuring robust predictive power on imbalanced credit portfolios.
- Automated data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model validation pipelines using Python libraries like pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn.
- Delivered actionable default risk scores to support portfolio stress testing and trading strategy development.

## Repository Contents

- `loan_data.csv/` — Sample datasets and synthetic loan portfolios used for modeling.
- `notebooks/` — Jupyter notebooks with step-by-step implementations of PD, LGD, and EAD models.
- `scripts/` — Python scripts for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
- `reports/` — Model validation reports and performance metrics.

## Key Skills & Technologies

- Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn)
- Classification Metrics: AUC, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix
- Credit Risk Frameworks: IFRS 9, Basel Accords concepts
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model validation and monitoring techniques

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:  
   `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/credit-risk-modelling-python.git`

2. Navigate to the project directory:  
   `cd credit-risk-modelling-python`

3. Install required packages:  
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`

4. Explore the notebook files to understand the modeling process:  
   `jupyter notebook notebooks/PD_Model.ipynb`

5. Run the scripts to preprocess data and train models as per your dataset and needs.
